- Change: Allow wildcards in history functions
  (Might break backwards compatibility in rare cases where code relies on 
   the '_' atom as a normal atom, it is now the wildcard pattern)
- Change: Add caller Pid to history
  *CAUTION* This will break backwards compatibility for functions that rely
  on the return value of history/1!
- New: function num_calls/3+4 that return number of calls made to a MFA spec.
- New: function called/4 that takes a caller Pid as argument
- New: function history/2 that takes a caller Pid as argument
- Change: By default, passthrough now records coverage statistics on original
  module (disable by using the 'no_passthrough_cover' option).
